## hkvfewspy
python wrapper for fews-Pi sevices

## installation

```bash
conda install geopandas 
pip install hkvfewspy
```

## usage

SOAP backend

```python

pi.setClient(wsdl='http://localhost:8081/FewsPiService/fewspiservice?wsdl')
```

REST backend

```python
import hkvfewspy as hkv
pi = hkv.Pi(protocol='rest')
pi.setUrl(url='http://localhost:8080/FewsWebServices/rest/fewspiservice/v1/')
```

## changelog
0.7

added REST protocol including
* setUrl
* getFilters
* getParameters
* getTimeSeries
* getTimeZoneID

initiate using:
* `pi = hkv.Pi(protocol='rest')` 
* default protocol is `soap` for backwards compatibilty
