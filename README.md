Python wrapper for FEWS-Pi sevices supporting both the SOAP and REST protocol

## installation
make sure you have all dependencies installed, and then install `hkvfewspy`.
```bash
pip install hkvfewspy
```

## usage

SOAP backend

```python
import hkvfewspy as hkv
pi = hkv.Pi() # or hkv.Pi(protocol='soap')
pi.setClient(wsdl='http://localhost:8081/FewsPiService/fewspiservice?wsdl')
```

REST backend

```python
import hkvfewspy as hkv
pi = hkv.Pi(protocol='rest')
pi.setUrl(url='http://localhost:8080/FewsWebServices/rest/fewspiservice/v1/')
```

## changelog
0.7

added REST protocol for the following functions
- setUrl
- getFilters
- getParameters
- getTimeSeries
- getTimeZoneID
- postTimeSeries

initiate using:
- `pi = hkv.Pi(protocol='rest')` 
- (default protocol is `soap` for backwards compatibilty)
- see this [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HKV-products-services/hkvfewspy/blob/master/notebooks/test%20REST%20endpoint.ipynb) for an example 

0.6.3
- removed geopandas as required dependencies
- setPiTimeSeries now includes miliseconds (FEWS support this since 2017.02 inc latest patch)


## available functions
- setClient ( for `soap` only )
- setUrl ( for `rest` only )
- postTimeSeries
- setQueryParameters
- setPiTimeSeries
- getFilters
- getParameters
- getTimeSeries
- getTimeZoneID
- getAvailableTimeZones
- getWorkflows
- getTaskRunStatus
- runTask
- putTimeSeriesForFilter ( for `soap` only )
- postTimeSeries ( for `rest` only)


## notebook
in the notebook folder are placed several jupyter notebooks with more examples.
the module has been tested against both embedded and public fews-Pi webservices in python2 and python3.
